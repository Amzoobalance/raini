# Workshop Difficulty Levels

There are five possible difficulty levels for workshops:

- n/a
- novice
- elementary
- intermediate
- advanced

The difficulty level of the workshop MUST be defined as two [shield.io](http://shields.io) badges, one for theory and one for practice. A workshop difficulty badge MUST be a link to this page (Workshop Difficulty Levels). To add badges to your repository, copy the suitable snippets given below. A workshop repository MUST have both the theory badge and the practice badge at the very top of the `README.md` file.

## A note on prerequisites

Difficulty levels of elementary and higher provide requirements from attendees that need to be met to feel comfortable during the workshop. The prerequisites MUST be outlined in the description of the workshop. If the prerequisites provide specific information to be studied, the information MUST be publicly available, free or paid. The prerequisites MAY be other workshops, articles, books, tutorials, etc.

## Difficulty level descriptions

### n/a

This badge indicates that the block is out of the scope of the workshop. Applicable, if a workshop does not have a theoretical or practical part.

### novice

The workshop is self-explanatory and NO prerequisites are required from attendees.
