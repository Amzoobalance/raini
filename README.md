**It is not a node school.**

## Introduction

Our mission is to evolve the tech industry through accessible education. We rely on the workshop education form with relatively small education programs.

Workshops can be conducted on various topics, but each workshop MUST fully cover **at least one** block of certification related to that topic.

### What's a workshop

We define workshop as follows:

> Workshop is a relatively small single- or multistep educational program designed to teach a small group of people theory and practice on a specific topic, including techniques or ideas, which they can then use in their work or daily lives.

This definition imposes the following constraints:

1. The educational program MUST be short and covered in no longer than 3 days (no longer than 8 hours per day, no exceptions. These hours include breaks)

2. The educational program MUST cover theory and practice for one specific topic. Intersections with related topics CAN take place, and the requirement holds for the main topic only.

3. The workshop MUST be held for a small group (10 to 25 people) so that the expense of organizing it makes sense AND everyone has the chance to be heard and paid some personal attention.

4. Information given in the workshop MUST be applicable in real-life scenarios.

## Goals

1. We see the certifications as the valid source of truth for evaluating one's knowledge. _Make certifications great again._

2. We empower people regardless of their prior experience. If a workshop requires prior knowledge, it MUST refer to a workshop conducted earlier that covers that topic. _Go from the bottom up._

3. We provide hands-on education. Each workshop provides theoretical foundation AND practical experience of applying it beyond "Hello, World!". _In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not._

4. We follow open/closed principle. We are happy for everybody to join and organize workshops anywhere and we share our experience as we work hard on making the process of creating those workshops clear and easy to follow for everyone. Our workshops are carefully curated and we only require one thing - you MUST follow the guidelines. It is a good thing for both you and us. _Be open for extension, but closed for modification._
